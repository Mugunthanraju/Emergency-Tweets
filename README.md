# Emergency-Tweets

### Description :-

**Many innocent people could not get emergency help when they are facing any sort trouble from the following :**

    1) Health
    2) Threat
    3) Nature Calamity

**This is because their message may not reach or get notified to respective departments. So we came up with a solution which will over come this problem using a greatest networking service provider in the world `Twitter`.**

We achived it by adding an extra button on `Sidebar of Twitter` Clone, by clicking button it directs to a webpage where we can all **Emergency Tweets** in three categories.
